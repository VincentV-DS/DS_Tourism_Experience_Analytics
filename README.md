🧳 Tourism Experience Analytics: Classification, Prediction, and Recommendation System
📌 Project Overview
Tourism Experience Analytics is a data-driven project that leverages machine learning techniques to enhance user experiences in the tourism sector. The system is designed to:

Predict attraction ratings

Classify modes of visit (Solo, Family, Group, Couple, etc.)

Recommend personalized tourist attractions

This project integrates EDA, ML models (regression, classification, recommendation), SQL queries, and an interactive Streamlit web app to deliver meaningful insights to both tourists and tourism service providers.
